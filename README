You will need maven to run the compelete test in one go:
Use command maven clean test or you can also run using the test functionality of maven.

I have create GUI and API framework in one framework, that's why it took more time. My initial plan was to create 2 different frameworks but then I thought of using hooks to separate GUI and API test cases.
I have not created separate files for data as the data used in this was very limited and I was running out of time as well.
Features written is also not as per the correct format but my entire time was spent on creation of the framework.

I have used Java verion 11.0.6, if you encounter any error while running the project then please let me know.

Hope you will like it.

Thanks & Regards,
Prem Kumar
